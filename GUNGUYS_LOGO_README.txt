IMPORTANT: Logo Image Required

To enable the tiled background feature, you need to add the Gun Guys II logo image to this directory.

1. Save the Gun Guys II logo image as: gunguys-logo.png
2. Place it in the client/public/ directory
3. The logo should be a circular logo with transparent or white background
4. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (will be scaled to 200x200 for tiling)

The background will automatically tile the logo at 8% opacity across the entire site.
