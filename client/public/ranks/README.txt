Place your rank logo images in this folder using the following filenames:

  - gm.png         (Grand Master)
  - master.png     (Master)
  - diamond.png    (Diamond)
  - platinum.png   (Platinum)
  - gold.png       (Gold)
  - bronze.png     (Bronze)

Any of these will be picked up automatically by the app. If a file is missing, the UI hides the logo gracefully.
